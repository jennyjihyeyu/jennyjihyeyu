## Hi I'm Jenny Yu ðŸ‘‹

### Senior majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics with minors in Psychological & Brain Sciences and Linguistics

Iâ€™m interested in machine learning and data-driven optimization. My research focuses on applying reinforcement learning techniques â€” especially Deep Q-Networks (DQN) â€” to real-time search problems, with applications in astrophysics and optical telescope scheduling. I'm passionate about developing intelligent systems that can make decisions under uncertainty, and bridging theoretical models with practical impact. Iâ€™m always eager to explore new challenges at the intersection of AI, data science, and real-world applications.
